## Challenge 1

We get an executable file, analyzing it in IDA we see that there are a bunch of
values being XORed with `0x7d` and checked against user input. So I wrote this
simple python script to extract the flag.

```
unxored = [
    0x1f, 0x08, 0x13, 0x13, 0x04, 0x22, 0x0E, 0x11, 0x4D, 0x0D, 0x18, 0x3D,
    0x1B, 0x11, 0x1C, 0x0F, 0x18, 0x50, 0x12, 0x13, 0x53, 0x1E, 0x12, 0x10
]

s = ''
for i in unxored:
    s += chr(i^0x7d)
print(s)
```
